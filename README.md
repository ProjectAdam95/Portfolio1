##  :beginner: About
  A first upload to my own personal website where i will continuously upload projects that i work on
  so i can display this as my own workspace and let people know who i am and what work i have done. This is not finalised and this website will be worked on and improved as i progress through my web development course.

Features include:
- Semantic HTML elements.
- Elements follow logical structure and layout.
- Accessible alt attributes for images displayed.
- Navigation links to sections of the page.
- About me section featuring a photo and description on who i am and what the website is about.
- Projects section featuring recent work/projects that i have completed. Thes projects can be clicked on the user can navigate to the desired webpage of choice. The first application project is larger as its my most recent project.
- Skills sections featuring the skills i use to build websites and design them. Each skill can be clicked on so the user viewing the website can find out more about what tools or languages i use to design webpages.
- Contact form so the user can enter a message directed to my email if the person wishes to contact me and make a request.
- Social media link below the contact form if someone wishes to follow my socials/GitHub or view my LinkeIn (in process of making). All additional information regarding my projects and portfolio can be found on my Github page.
- The webpage has been made accesible for all screen sizes and devices so users can view a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
